    % (2) Select, calculate, and plot a single representative answer. Click on "Save FR & ISS" button to save the currently selected data point. 
    %     Keep the plot for this answer up, Click on "Plot ISS Analysis"

% save workspace and the ISS plot in the same folder as the raw data
% caution!!! this will overwrite data if files with the same name already exists
save([folder,'Analysis ' tnum])           % saves your entire workspace
set(gcf,'PaperPositionMode','auto')       % makes the plots full screen
saveas(gcf,[folder, 'ISS ' tnum], 'png')  % grabs the current plot, close others you don't want
